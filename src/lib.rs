//! This is the 'library' root. It serves the point of listing the modules that
//! are part of the tsptw crate. Having such a library in addition to the main
//! file is not necessary per-se. Indeed, it would be sufficient to just list 
//! all the modules at the beginning of the main.rs file. However, I don't like
//! to list all modules at the beginning of my main. This is why I perfer to 
//! have a library alongside the main.rs. It is thus purely a matter of my 
//! personal taste.
